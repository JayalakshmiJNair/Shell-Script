Shell-Script is a collection of basic shell scripts aimed at helping users understand and automate common tasks in Unix/Linux environments. This set includes scripts like count_lines_words_characters.sh to count lines, words, and characters in a file, count_of_users.sh to display the number of users, and create_file.sh to create new files easily. Other scripts such as exec_right.sh check executable permissions, file_integrity.sh verifies file integrity, and file_names.sh helps with listing or filtering file names. Additionally, list_of_files.sh lists files in directories, glossary.sh provides a simple glossary or reference, running_shell.sh identifies the current running shell, and user_loggedin.sh shows users currently logged in. These scripts serve as practical tools for beginners and intermediate users to explore shell scripting while automating routine operations in the terminal.
